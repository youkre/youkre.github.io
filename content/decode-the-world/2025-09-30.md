I didn’t realize I was building something that would matter so much to me.

When I started writing the first line of `subscription-api` in Go, I was just trying to solve a problem: how to manage user subscriptions across Apple IAP, Alipay, and WeChat Pay. There was no team, no architecture meeting, no CI/CD pipeline. Just me, a text editor, and a growing sense of ownership.

Over the next few years, I built everything from the ground up:

- The backend in Go (Echo/Chi) [subscription-api](https://github.com/FTChinese/subscription-api)
- The CMS for managing subscription manually [superyard](https://github.com/FTChinese/superyard)
- The web frontend [superyard-react](https://github.com/FTChinese/superyard-react), [read-react](https://github.com/FTChinese/reader-react)
- Even a small library to reuse patterns [go-rest](https://github.com/FTChinese/go-rest)

I made thousands of commits. I debugged payment callbacks at midnight. I wrote documentation no one would read. I optimized database queries for faster load times. I set up Jenkins to automate deployments — and taught the ops team how to use it.

And then, one day, I left.

It wasn’t because the code was broken. It was because I was tired.

Tired of being told, “What’s the point of writing good code if the boss can’t see it?”

Tired of hearing, “The company might close tomorrow,” with no follow-up, no clarity.

Tired of feeling invisible.

I wanted to make more money — not for luxury, but to buy my mother a home. I thought leaving would solve that. Instead, I ended up with a two-month job on my resume, and a heart full of regret.

The systems I built are still there, frozen in time. No one has touched them since I left. They’re “dead” in the sense that they’re not evolving — but they’re alive in the sense that they still work. They were built to last.

I look at the GitHub repositories now, and I cry. Not because I failed, but because I cared so much.

I cared about clean code.

I cared about reliability.

I cared about making something that worked, quietly, every day.

If I could go back, I wouldn’t change the code.

I’d change how I treated myself.

I’d ask for help.

I’d talk to someone.

I’d remind myself: **what you’re doing matters, even if no one says it does.**

This blog post isn’t a technical deep dive. It’s a letter to my past self — and to anyone who’s ever built something in silence, loved it deeply, and walked away.

To my old code: thank you for teaching me what it means to be an engineer.

I’m not done yet.
